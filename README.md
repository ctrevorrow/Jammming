## What Is This?
  This is a web app I created as the capstone project for a course I took to learn ReactJS.

## Original Project Requirements
Below is the original instructions with projects requirements, a video demonstration of how the finished web app should work, features the finished web app should have, and some resources so we can focus on the Javascript/React portion of the project.
  ### Summary
  Use your knowledge of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
  
  ### Video Demonstration

  ### Features
  Below is a list of the website's features:
  - Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account. You will need to follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register your application.
  - Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).
  - Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
  - Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
  - Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.
  - Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
  - Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

  ### Resources
  Because we want you to focus on building the React infrastructure, we have provided links to the HTML/CSS and visual assets below. Notice, we did not break the HTML and CSS into their components. To complete the project you will need to split the HTML/CSS into their components.
  - [index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexHtml.txt) — all of the HTML for a static version of the website.
  - [style.css](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexCss.txt) — all of the CSS for a static version of the website.
  - [image assets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/image_assets.zip) — all of the image assets used in the website.

## Credits
  Giving credit where it's due:
  - This project was started using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
  - The _original_ CSS and images were written/procured by someone at Codecademy (https://codecademy.com)
    - These assets have been changed slightly as of this writing, and I have plans to overhaul the CSS.
